# Information Security Course Repository

This repository contains three Python projects related to Information Security. Each project has its own directory with the necessary code and documentation to understand the project's purpose and how it works.

## 1. IP Scan, Port Scan, and Ping Application

The purpose of this project is to develop a Command Line Interface (CLI) application that facilitates network scans on a target IP address. This app has various features that enable users to scan for open ports, perform a ping test, and gather information about the target IP's operating system. The main goal of this application is to provide fast and efficient results to users, enabling them to promptly obtain relevant information about their network environment.

## 2. Encryptor and Decryption Package

This project is a Jupyter Notebook that enables users to encrypt and decrypt text messages using multiple encryption techniques.  The app supports several encryption algorithms, such as `AES` and `RSA`. The primary objective of this project is to highlight the significance of encryption in communication and showcase the diverse range of techniques that can be employed for this purpose.

## 3. Malware (System Information Collector)

This project is a Python-based CLI (Command Line Interface) application that gathers critical system information and transmits it to a server for further analysis. The application is designed to run seamlessly on the client's system, and collect hardware information, operating system details, and other vital system-related data. The collected information is then transmitted to a waiting server.
The main objective of this project is to offer an accessible and convenient solution for collecting and transmitting system information. The CLI interface ensures that users can easily run the program and transmit the information, without the need for a graphical user interface.
